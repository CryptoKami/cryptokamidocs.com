# Cryptokami SL Launcher

## Overview

An executable
[`cryptokami-launcher`](/technical/cli-options/#cryptokami-launcher)
is a tool for launching Cryptokami SL. It actually runs the whole Cryptokami SL system
(i.e. a node, a wallet) and handles updates. To do this, `cryptokami-launcher` uses two
separate tools: [`cryptokami-node`](/technical/cli-options/#cryptokami-node) and
[`cryptokami-updater`](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-updater).

Please see [`cryptokami-launcher`'s description](/technical/cli-options/#cryptokami-launcher)
for detailed information about available options.

## Scenarios

There are two work scenarios for `cryptokami-launcher`: client scenario and server scenario.
If you provide a path to the wallet (e.g. Daedalus) using `--wallet` argument during
start, `cryptokami-node` will run in
[client](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L178)
scenario, otherwise it will run in
[server](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L171)
one.

### Server Scenario

After the start, there are 2 steps:

1.  Running an updater.
2.  Running a node.

Updater's work is explained [below](#updater).

A node is [spawning as a separate
process](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L280).
After that we just [wait until the node
stops](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L201).
After a node exits, its exit code is checked. If it equals `20`, we [restart the
launcher](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L204),
otherwise we quit.

Log info can be [written to the log file](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L207) before quitting. To do it, we must
provide two additional arguments during launcher's start: `--report-server` and
`--node-log`. The first argument defines an URL of the report server, the second
one defines a path to the log file. We asynchronously [send log info to the
report server](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L343).
Please note that the file from the `--node-log` argument must exist.

### Client Scenario

As the process starts, there are 3 steps:

1.  Running an updater.
2.  Running a node.
3.  Running a wallet.

For steps 1 and 2, see [Server Scenario](#server-scenario) above.

The wallet is [spawning as a separate
process](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L227).

After that, we [wait until node or wallet
stops](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L228).
When it stops, we check it:

1.  If the node exits, we write a log (see [Server Scenario](#server-scenario)
    above for explanations) and [wait for the wallet's
    death](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L235).
2.  If the wallet exits, we check the exit code, and if it equals `20`, we
    [kill the node](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L242)
    and [restart the launcher in the client
    scenario](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L244).
    Please note that killing the node isn't executed immediately; the node is
    killed after some timeout, and its value is obtained from the
    `--node-timeout` argument mentioned above.
3.  If the wallet exits *and* exit code isn't equal to `20`, we
    [kill the node](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L250)
    immediately.

## Updater

Another important thing `cryptokami-launcher` does is updating a node. The first
step in both scenarios is [running an
updater](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L255).

The core idea is very simple. The node update is a special `.tar`-archive: it
represents the *difference* between the old (current) version of the node and a
new version of it. A path to this archive is obtained via `--update-archive`
argument. So, `cryptokami-updater` applies this archive to the node, and after
restart a new version of the node can be used.

Please note that when we run `cryptokami-launcher` in the client scenario, a wallet's
user is able to see that an update is ready, and there are two situations
possible.

If a user *agrees* to apply this update, the wallet exits immediately with an
exit code `20`. In this case, as described above, launcher restarts the node and
the update is applied.

If a user *doesn't agree* to apply this update, the wallet continues working.
But when it *is* restarted (sooner or later), that update [*will* be applied](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L223).

**Important**: the updater runs synchronously, we start it and then [wait for it to
finish](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L269).
If the updater finishes its work
[successfully](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L271),
the`.tar`-archive is deleted.
