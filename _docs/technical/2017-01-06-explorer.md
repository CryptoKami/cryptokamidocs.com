# Cryptokami SL Explorer

As [mentioned earlier](/cryptokami/explorer), Explorer is a service for searching
information about [transactions](/glossary/#transaction),
[addresses](/glossary/#address) and time periods ([epochs](/glossary/#epoch) and
[slots](/glossary/#slot)) in the Cryptokami network.

## Explorer Backend Workflow

Explorer starts with
[CLI-options](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl-explorer/blob/f64fb137415c03e8569129067a7798bb8a51456c/src/explorer/ExplorerOptions.hs#L25).
All supported options can be viewed by `cryptokami-explorer --help` command.

Then explorer [runs "internal"
node](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl-explorer/blob/f64fb137415c03e8569129067a7798bb8a51456c/src/explorer/Main.hs#L74)
via `cryptokami-sl` library. So we can think of explorer's backend as of a common
node with [two special
plugins](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl-explorer/blob/f64fb137415c03e8569129067a7798bb8a51456c/src/explorer/Main.hs#L70):
`explorerPlugin` and `notifierPlugin`.

The first plugin is for serving [explorer web
API](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl-explorer/blob/e343db1def575cc2a47d9168414c22c2599c50e6/src/Pos/Explorer/Web/Api.hs#L25).
The second one [starts notification
server](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl-explorer/blob/e343db1def575cc2a47d9168414c22c2599c50e6/src/Pos/Explorer/Socket/App.hs#L164).
This websocket-based server notifies frontend about changes with
blocks/transactions.

## Explorer Backend API

Currently, the explorer web API provides a series of methods to obtain
information from the Cryptokami network. The `servant` Haskell library that
provides a modular approach to API-building is used. This library uses
combinators both to build atomic HTTP actions and to glue these atomic methods
together to form larger and more complete APIs.

### HTTP API

Explorer web API is defined
[here](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl-explorer/blob/f64fb137415c03e8569129067a7798bb8a51456c/src/Pos/Explorer/Web/Api.hs#L25).
If the event requests fail, there is a
[`ExplorerError`](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl-explorer/blob/f64fb137415c03e8569129067a7798bb8a51456c/src/Pos/Explorer/Web/Error.hs#L11)
type, which is simply a wrapper over `Text` to show what happened.

Documentation for explorer web API is available
[here](https://cryptokamidocs.com/technical/explorer/api/).

### socket.io API

We currently have these events a client can register to:

``` haskell
data ClientEvent
    = Subscribe Subscription
    | Unsubscribe Subscription
    | CallMe
```

A subscription can be to the following events:

``` haskell
data Subscription
    = SubAddr
    | SubBlockLastPage
    | SubTx
```

And the coresponding server events are here:

``` haskell
data ServerEvent
    = AddrUpdated
    | BlocksLastPageUpdated
    | TxsUpdated
    | CallYou
```

A user can call the desired events and subscribe to them:

``` js
var client = require('socket.io-client');
var socket = client('http://localhost:8110');

socket.on('CallYou', function(msg){ console.log(msg); })
socket.emit('CallMe', 'test');
```

You can also try running purescript repl (`pulp psci`) and then playing around
with the events:

``` purescript
import Prelude
import Control.SocketIO.Client
import Control.Monad.Eff.Console

let socket = connect "http://localhost:8110"

socket >>= \soc -> emit soc "CallYou" "test"
```
