# Testnet Era

The Cryptokami SL test network (the testnet) is required to get the community
acquainted with the cryptocurrency and to polish the implementation, eliminating
possible flaws or instabilities.

During the Testnet era all functionality, including the reward mechanism, are
activated. Anyone is able to redeem a private key from Cryptokami SL Testnet Faucet
to get their coin supply.

We encourage everyone to download Cryptokami SL client for their platform, get some
coins (we call them [Lovelace](/glossary/#lovelace)) from the faucet, and invite
other people to participate in beta testing.

The result of the Testnet era is the [release](/timeline/bootstrap) of Cryptokami SL.
