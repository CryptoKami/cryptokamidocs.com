# Cryptokami SL Technical Details

This section is a starting point for developers who wish to contribute to the
original client, as well as those who wish to undertake making their own client
for Cryptokami SL. Nonetheless, this section covers the original client to great
extent, assuming that it will be the initial reference client for some time.

## High-level overview

A Cryptokami SL node is a blockchain node. When ran, it finds other nodes (via
[DHT](http://ast-deim.urv.cat/cpairot/dhts.html)) and then starts performing
blockchain-related procedures.

Time in Cryptokami SL is divided into *epochs*. Every epoch is divided into
*slots*. Epochs and slots are numbered. Therefore, the slot `(3,5)` is read as
"the fifth slot of the third epoch" (the 0-th slot and the 0-th epoch are also
possible).

Cryptokami SL uses sets of constants, special values defined in
[the `constants.yaml` configuration file](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/bf5dd592b7bf77a68bf71314718dc7a8d5cc8877/core/constants.yaml).
There are two main sets: for production mode and development mode. In this guide
we'll refer to productions constants.

Suppose the values for Cryptokami SL are:

-   slot duration: 120 seconds,
-   security parameter *k*: 60.

In other words, **a slot lasts 120 seconds**, and an epoch has [`10×k`](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/9ee12d3cc9ca0c8ad95f3031518a4a7acdcffc56/core/Pos/Core/Constants/Raw.hs#L161)
slots in it, so it lasts **1200 minutes** or **20 hours**.

There is one node called the slot leader on each slot. Only this node has right
to generate a new block during this slot; this block will be added to the
blockchain. However, there's no guarantee that new block will be actually
generated (e.g. slot leader can be offline during a corresponding slot).

Furthermore, slot leader may delegate its right to another node `N`; in this
case node `N` will have a right to generate a new block instead of slot leader.
Please note that node `N` with delegated right is not called a slot leader
though, it is just a delegate.

It's theoretically possible to delegate the slot leader's right to multiple
nodes, but it is **not** recommended by reasons explained later. Moreover, we can
run multiple nodes with the same key (i.e. on one computer), let's say nodes
`A`, `B` and `C`, and if node `A` is elected as the slot leader, not only `A`
itself, but nodes `B` and `C` will be able to generate a new block as well. In
this case, every one of these nodes will issue a most probably different block,
and the network will fork — each other node will accept **only one** of these
concurrent blocks. Later, this fork will be eliminated.

During the epoch, nodes send each other MPC messages to come to the consensus as
to who would be allowed to generate blocks in the next epoch. Payloads from
`Data` messages (along with transactions) are included into blocks.

The more currency (or "stake") an address holds, the more likely it is to be
chosen to generate a block. Please read about [Ouroboros Proof of Stake Algorithm](/cryptokami/proof-of-stake/)
for more details.

In short:

1.  send messages,
2.  receive messages/transactions/etc,
3.  form a block (if you are the slot leader),
4.  repeat.

## Business logic

### Listeners

Listeners handle incoming messages and respond to them. Various supplemental
listeners will not be covered, focusing on the main ones instead.

Listeners mostly use the [Relay
framework](/technical/protocols/csl-application-level/#invreqdata-and-messagepart),
which includes three type of messages:

-   `Inventory` message: node publishes message to network when gets a new data.
-   `Request` message: node requests a new data which was published in
    `Inventory` message, from other node, if this data is not known yet by
    this node.
-   `Data` message: node replies with this message on `Request` message. `Data`
    message contains concrete data.

For instance, when a user creates a new transaction, the wallet sends
`Inventory` message with transaction id to the network. If the node that has
received `Inventory` doesn't know any transaction with such id, then it replies
with `Request` message, after that the wallet sends this transaction in `Data`
message. After the node has received the `Data` message, it can send the
`Inventory` message to its neighbors in DHT network and repeat previous
iterations again.

Another example - block listeners [`handleGetHeaders`](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/69e896143cb02612514352e286403852264f0ba3/src/Pos/Block/Network/Listeners.hs#L30),
[`handleGetBlocks`](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/69e896143cb02612514352e286403852264f0ba3/src/Pos/Block/Network/Listeners.hs#L50),
[`handleBlockHeaders`](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/69e896143cb02612514352e286403852264f0ba3/src/Pos/Block/Network/Listeners.hs#L77).

### Workers

A Worker is an action repeated with some interval. For example:

-   [`onNewSlotWorker`](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/69e896143cb02612514352e286403852264f0ba3/infra/Pos/Communication/Protocol.hs#L218): Runs at the beginning of each slot. Does some cleanup and
    then runs additional functions. This worker also creates a
    *genesis block* at the beginning of the epoch. There are two kinds of
    blocks: "genesis blocks" and "main blocks". Main blocks are stored in the
    blockchain; genesis blocks are generated by each node internally between
    epochs. Genesis blocks aren't announced to other nodes. However, a node may
    request a genesis block from someone else for convenience, if this node was
    offline for some time and needs to catch up with the blockchain.
-   [`blkOnNewSlot`](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/d01d392d49db8a25e17749173ec9bce057911191/src/Pos/Block/Worker.hs#L69): Creates
    a new block (when it is the node's turn to create a new block) and announces it
    to other nodes.

## Proof of Stake

At the heart of Cryptokami SL sits the Ouroboros Proof of Stake protocol, as
described in [the whitepaper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889) of the same
name.

## Forks

Generally, one chain (the *main chain*) is maintained by a node, but eventually
alternative chains may arise. Recall that only blocks `k` and more slots deep are
considered stable. This way, if a block which is neither a part nor a
continuation of our blockchain is received, we first check if its complexity is
bigger than ours (the complexity is the length of the chain), and then we start
subsequently requesting previous blocks from the node that provided an
alternative chain header. If we come deeper than `k` slots ago, the alternative
chain gets rejected. Otherwise, once we get to the block existing in our chain,
the alternative chain is added to storage. From the standpoint of state, we
store and maintain all the alternative chains that are viable. If it appears
that an alternative chain is longer than the main chain, they are swapped,
making the alternative chain the new main chain.

## Supplemental parts

### Slotting

The consensus scheme we use relies on correct slotting. More specifically, it
relies on the assumption that nodes in the system have access to the current
time (small deviations are acceptable), which is then used to figure out when
any particular slot begins and ends, and perform particular actions in this
slot.

System start time is a timestamp of the `(0,0)` slot (i.e. the 0-th slot of the 0-th
epoch).

## P2P Network

### Peer discovery

We use Kademlia DHT for peer discovery. It is a general solution for distributed
hash tables, based on [a whitepaper by Petar Maymounkov and David Mazières,
2002](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf).

However, we only take advantage of its peer discovery mechanism, and use none of
its hash table capabilities.

In short, each node in the Kademlia network is provided a `160`-bit id generated
randomly. The distance between the nodes is defined by `XOR` metric. The network
is organized in such a way that node knows no more than `K` (`K=7` in the
original client implementation) nodes for each relative distance range:
`2^i < d <= 2^(i+1)`.

Initial peer discovery is done by
[sending](https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/bbdca50c263c6dae251e67eb36a7d4e1ba7c1cb6/src/Network/Kademlia/Implementation.hs#L194)
a Kademlia `FIND_NODE` message with our own node id as a parameter to [a
pre-configured set of
nodes](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/43a2d079a026b90ba860e79b5be52d1337e26c6f/src/Pos/Constants.hs#L89)
and the nodes passed by the user on the command line. Our implementation
[sends](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/43a2d079a026b90ba860e79b5be52d1337e26c6f/infra/Pos/DHT/Real/Real.hs#L228)
this request to all known peers at once and then waits for the first reply.

While the client runs, it collects peers per Kademlia protocol. The list of
known peers is preserved and
[restored](https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/bbdca50c263c6dae251e67eb36a7d4e1ba7c1cb6/src/Network/Kademlia.hs#L197)
between subsequent launches. For each peer, we keep their [host and port
number](https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/bbdca50c263c6dae251e67eb36a7d4e1ba7c1cb6/src/Network/Kademlia/Types.hs#L42),
as well as their [node
id](https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/bbdca50c263c6dae251e67eb36a7d4e1ba7c1cb6/src/Network/Kademlia/Types.hs#L70).

### Messaging

Kademlia already provides the notion of nodes that are known. Such nodes can be
called *neighbors*. To send message to all nodes in a network, you can send it
to neighbors, they will resend it to their neighbors, and so on. But sometimes
we may need to not propagate messages across all network, but send it to
neighbors only. Hence we have three types of sending messages:

-   send to a node,
-   send to neighbors,
-   send to network.

#### Message types

To handle this, three kind of message headers are used, and there are two
message types:

-   Simple: sending to a single peer.
-   Broadcast: attempting to send to the entire network, iteratively sending
    messages to neighbors.

Broadcast messages are resent to neighbors right after retrieval (before
handling). Also, they are being checked against LRU cache, and messages that
have been already received once get ignored.

### Leaders and rich men computation (LRC)

"Slot leaders" and "rich men" are two important notions of Ouroboros Proof of
Stake Algorithm.

-   Slot leaders: Slot leaders for the current epoch (for each slot of the
    current epoch) are computed by [Follow the
    Satoshi](/cryptokami/proof-of-stake/#follow-the-satoshi) (FTS) algorithm in the
    beginning of current epoch. FTS uses a `shared seed` which is result of
    [Multi Party Computation](/cryptokami/proof-of-stake/#multi-party-computation)
    (MPC) algorithm for previous epoch: in the result of MPC some nodes reveal
    their seeds, `xor` of these seeds is called `shared seed`.

-   Rich men: Only nodes that have sent their VSS certificates and also have
    enough stake can participate in the MPC algorithm. So in the beginning of
    epoch node must know all potential participants for validation of MPC
    messages during this epoch. Rich men are also computed in the beginning of
    current epoch.

Rich men are important for other components as well; for instance, Update system
uses rich men for checking that node can publish update proposal and vote.

There are two ways of computing who the rich men will be: - considering common
stake - considering delegated stake (Ouroboros provides opportunity to delegate
own stake to other node, see more in [Delegation
section](/cryptokami/differences/#stake-delegation))

MPC and Update System components need rich men with delegated stake, but
Delegation component with common stake.

## Constants

Cryptokami SL uses a list of the fundamental constants. Their values have been
discussed with the original authors of the protocol as well as independent
security auditors, so reusing these constants is strongly recommended for
alternative clients.

Values of these constants are defined in
[the `constants.yaml` configuration file](https://github.com/CryptoKami/cryptokami-sl/blob/bf5dd592b7bf77a68bf71314718dc7a8d5cc8877/core/constants.yaml),
for production and development environments separately.
