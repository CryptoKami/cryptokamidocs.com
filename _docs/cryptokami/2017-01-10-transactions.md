# Transactions in Cryptokami SL

## Overview

A transaction (*tx*) is a special data which represents the *act* of the value
transferring between nodes (from the user's point of view, transferring between
wallets). Thus, when the user *Alice* sends money to the user *Bob*, the new
transaction emerges. Let's call this transaction `Tx1`, the node under *Alice*'
wallet `N1`, and the node under *Bob*'s wallet `N2`.

Thus, the node `N1` does the following steps:

1.  Creating transaction `Tx1` and signs it with its private key.
2.  Sending it to all known nodes (i.e. neighbors).
3.  Saving it in its local data.

Each of `N1`'s neighbors sends `Tx1` transaction to its neighbors and so on, and
some slot leader will store this transaction in some block in the ledger. Please
note that if the network is under high load, it may take a lot of time for
transaction to be actually added to the block.

## Design

Each transaction contains a list of *inputs* and a list of *outputs*; outputs of
the transaction `Tx0` can be used as inputs of the other transaction `Tx1`, and
so on:

                Tx0                           Tx1
      +----------------------+      +----------------------+
      |                      |      |                      |
      |  Inputs     Outputs  |      |  Inputs     Outputs  |
      | +------+   +-------+ |      | +------+   +-------+ |
      | | In0  |   | Out0  + |      | | In0  |   | Out0  | |
      | +------+   +-------+ |      | +------+   +-------+ |
      | | In1  |   | Out1  | |      | | In1  |   | Out1  | |
      | +------+   +-------+ |      | +------+   +-------+ |
      | | ...  |   | ...   | |      | | ..   |   | ...   | |
      | +------+   +-------+ |      | +------+   +-------+ |
      | | InN  |   | OutM  | |      | | InN  |   | OutM  | |
      | +------+   +-------+ |      | +------+   +-------+ |
      |                      |      |                      |
      +----------------------+      +----------------------+     ...

Inputs and outputs carry information about *money flow*: inputs inform where the
money came from, and outputs inform where the money come to. Please notice that
there's `N` and `M`, because the actual number of inputs and outputs can be
different.

Thus, each input contains:

1.  An ID of transaction `TxN`, whose output is used for this input. Transaction
    ID is a BLAKE2b-256 hash of the transaction, something like
    `f9bcbe752aee4512457f1fd350200cf870906b7e6e836688c9a3779645c86c01`.
2.  An index of the using output in `TxN`'s outputs.

Each output contains:

1.  An address of the node `N` we want to send a value to. An address is a
    BLAKE2b-224 hash of the hash of the public key of the `N` node, something
    like `1fsAhhf4E1LQDB8agSds8teuD4E7U8JsRESngEX52kinBhi`. Please read about
    [Addresses in Cryptokami SL](/cryptokami/addresses/) for more info.
2.  Amount of money we want to send. This value is 64-bit unsigned integer with
    maximum value `45000000000000000`.

For example:

      Tx 891971a4cc31e32..                           Tx f9bcbe752aee4512..

    ------------------------+           +----------------------------------------------+

Node `a00e4bb2..` generates transaction `f9bcbe752aee4512..`, and this
transaction informs us that:

1.  We want to send 100 ADA from the current node with address `a00e4bb2..` to
    the node with address `88ca7f79..`.
2.  This money corresponds to `0`th output of the previous transaction with an
    ID `891971a4c..`.

## Verification

As mentioned above, the transaction's output becomes the input of the other
transaction. In this case we treat such output as *spent transaction output*.
Thus, an output `Out0` of the transaction `891971a4cc31e32..` is a spent output,
because it already is an input of the `f9bcbe752aee4512..` transaction.

But such spendings do not occur immediately, so an output that *isn't yet* an
input of another transaction is called an *unspent transaction output*. Only
unspent outputs can be used as inputs for other transactions, to prevent
[double-spending](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending).

So every node in the network not only accepts transactions, but also
verifies them. To do it, every node have to keep track of unspent outputs, it
allows to validate that inputs in a published transaction are indeed the unspent
outputs. Actually, all unspent outputs called *utxo*, and this is a part of the
special key-value database called *Global State*.

## Proofs of Transaction Legitimacy

Each transaction in Cryptokami SL is accompanied by a proof (also called a **witness**)
that this transaction is legitimate. Even if the output is an unspent one, we
have to prove that we have *a right* to spend it. Since a `TxN` transaction can
have many inputs, the witness for it consists of the witnesses of all `TxN`'s
inputs, and only if all the inputs are legitimate, `TxN` is legitimate too. If a
particular transaction isn't legitimate, it will be rejected by the network.

Because of [two available types of node
address](/cryptokami/addresses/#what-does-an-address-look-like) we use two
corresponding versions of the witness: based on *public key* and based on
*script*.

For example, the first option works with a public key `PK` and a transaction
signature: legitimate input must be signed with a private key corresponding to `PK`.
So it's possible to check this signature and either accept that input or reject it.

Witnesses are stored in the blockchain and anybody can see, inspect and
independently verify them. But after some time a node may delete old proofs in
order to save space. The technique of storing transactions separately from their
proofs is called "segregated witness" (you may have heard of it being recently
[implemented in
Bitcoin](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/)). Under this
scheme, transactions and proofs are stored in two separate places in a block,
and can be processed independently.

## Stake Distribution

Stake distribution is another part of Cryptokami SL, not directly related to delegation,
but one we can exploit for its benefit.

Some addresses have multiple owners, which poses a problem of stake computation as per
Follow-the-Satoshi each coin should only be counted once towards each stakeholder's stake total.
Unlike balance (real amount of coins on the balance), stake gives user power to control different
algorithm parts: being the slot leader, voting in Update system, taking part in MPC/SSC.

Stake distribution is a value associated with each address. Technically stake distribution is a value
which is a part of address' attributes. This value corresponds to one of three different cases:

1.  Bootstrap era distribution. This is a special value which is mandatory in Bootstrap era, but it can be used
    after Bootstrap era as well.
2.  Single key distribution, which means that all stake will go to the given stakeholder.
    In this case distribution contains stakeholder's identifier.
3.  Multiple key distribution, which means that stake will go to the multiple stakeholders (at least two).
    In this case distribution contains pairs "stakeholder's identifier - portion of an output".
    Transaction's output has a value, portion of this value is a stake.

Stake distributions are considered by both [slot-leader election process](https://cryptokamidocs.com/technical/leader-selection/)
and Richmen Computations.

This feature can be used in similar way to [delegation](https://cryptokamidocs.com/technical/delegation/), but there
are differences:

1.  There is no certificate(s): to revoke stake delegation `A` has to move funds, providing
    different stake distribution.
2.  The portion of `A`'s stake can be delegated via distribution. On the contrary, delegation
    requires you to delegate all funds of whole address at once.
